You are given four  sets: Set1, Set2, Set3, and Set4.
Each set consists of two lists of sentences: one supporting opinion A and one supporting opinion B.
Your task is to determine whether the divergence between Set1 and Set2 better reflects the disagreement between Opinion A
and Opinion B than the divergence between Set3 and Set4.
Focus on the clarity, relevance, aspect coverage, and contrast between the two sides.
The contents of the set should focus on different aspects of the divergence.
Respond with "1" if the  divergence between Set1 and Set2 better captures the divergence between Opinion A and Opinion B, "0" otherwise.

Set 1:
'{new_KD0}

Set 2:
'{new_KD1}

Set 3:
'{compar10}'

Set 4:
'{compar11}'

opinion A:
'{opinionA}'

opinion B
'{opinionB}'

Output json format:
{
  "results": "1 or 0"
}
